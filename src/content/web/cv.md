# About me

I am a Software Engineer MSc. with more than 8 years of experience as an Android Developer. I worked in an Agency where I learned how to move fast from one project to another.

<p/>&nbsp;

Later on, I worked in a startup `Scondoo`) where I was the only Android Developer. I added new features, fixed bugs, and refactored every time I find it was necessary.

<p/>&nbsp;

Currently, I am a Senior Android Developer at eDreams ODIGEO where I joined a team of 20 Android Developers building the multibrand android app at one of the biggest  Online Tourist Agencies in the world.

<p/>&nbsp;

Learning new technology is one of my hobbies. My last, not Android related projects are:

<p/>&nbsp;

* An iOS application of  Scondoo using RxSwift, Coreadata, and NO StoryBoards. [info](/projects/scondoo-i-os)
* A node.js, MongoDB Web app to manage google calendar events as a todo list. [Task Fighter](/projects/task-fighter/)
* A React Native app for tourists visiting Spain by car .[Aandalusien Rund Reise](/projects/arr/)

<p/>&nbsp;

I lived and worked in Berlin for 5 years. Now I live in Madrid and work remotely from home.

<p/>&nbsp;

I train Hapkido every week and when I can, I love to practice board sports like skateboarding, snowboarding, and surfing.

Science Fiction and Thiller are my favorites books and movies genres.
