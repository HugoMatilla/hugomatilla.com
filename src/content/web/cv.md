# About me

I am a Software Engineer MSc. with more than 8 years of experience as an Android Developer. I worked in an Agency where I learned how to move fast from one project to another.
Later on  I worked in a startup `Scondoo`) where I was the only Android Developer. I added new features, fixed bugs and refactored every time I find it was necessary.
Currently, I am a Senior Android Developer at eDreams ODIGEO where I joined a team of 20 Android Developers building the multibrand android app at one of the biggest  Online Tourist Agencies in the world.


Learning new technology is one of my hobbies. My last, not Android related projects are:
* An iOS application of  Scondoo using RxSwift, Coreadata, and no StoryBoards.
* A node.js, MongoDB Web app to manage google calendar events as a todo list. [Task Fighter](/task-fighter/)
* A React Native app for tourists visiting Spain by car.[Arr](/arr/)

I am Spanish and lived in Berlin for 5 years. Now I live in Madrid and work remotely from home or a co-working space.
