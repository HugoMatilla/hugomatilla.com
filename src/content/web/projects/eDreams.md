<p/>
&nbsp;

Currently, I am a Senior Android Developer at eDreams ODIGEO where I joined a team of 20 Android Developers building the multibrand android app at one of the biggest Online Tourist Agencies in the world.

<p/>
&nbsp;

The Native team consists of more than 50 people from Developers to PO, Leads, and Designers.

<p/>
&nbsp;

I carried out development tasks, mentoring, and improvement proposals. I also had the opportunity to learn about different technologies and ways of working.

<!-- 
<p/>
&nbsp;

I am part of the team (`POD`) developing the bookingflow of the application.

<p/>
&nbsp;

Besides my day to day in the  `POD`, I carry overall Android tasks.

<p/>
&nbsp;

* Recently I was part of the team making the proof of concept of integrating Koin as our Dependency Injection Framework. 
* Now I am working on simplifing the styles and move to a modern Android Styling system using theming technics. -->
