I've taken the role of Senior Android Developer at Qonto during a particularly exciting phase in the company's growth. Joining the team during this scale-up period has been an invigorating experience, as it comes with a multitude of responsibilities and challenges that keep me engaged and constantly learning.
<p/>
&nbsp;

My primary focus at Qonto is on our Android app, where I've been tasked with a wide range of responsibilities. From optimizing the user experience and enhancing the app's performance to implementing new features that align with our customers' needs.
<p/>
&nbsp;

Working in a scale-up environment has provided me with the opportunity to wear many hats and be part of a dynamic team that values innovation and creativity. It's been a rewarding journey, and I look forward to contributing further to Qonto's mission of delivering a top-notch mobile banking experience to our customers.
<p/>
&nbsp;

As a Senior Android Developer in this fast-paced environment, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what our app can achieve and ensuring that Qonto remains at the forefront of digital banking innovation.
