REVIEW TEXT PENDING

I like web technologies even it is not my expertise field I enjoy making websites. 
The first website I made was in pure HTML/CSS then I moved to Jekyll and my last approach was with Gatsby.js

I was learning React and being able to have a 100% in all [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) Categories was a plus. 
Also I love the speed that it provides moving from the home page to blogs is a blast.  
I added Material Design using the [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) library. But I has some problems deplying it to Netlifly via git pushes, so for every update I wanted to make I had to build the site locally and drag and drop the public folder to my netlify project.
That was not ideal but since I was not updating very often (almost never) It was good enough.

Years passed and I decided that I wanted to write Android Articles again, so I did it. But when I wanted to published my first ine in my Gatsby Site the deploy problem was bigger. 

Since I dinn't want to fix a 3 years old site I decide to build a new one from scratch. I loved Gatsby but not that much of Ract. In the other hand I rally like Vue. Not an expert but I find easier to apply it in anywhere. So ijust searched Gatsby for Vue and I found Gridsome.

Gridsome has the same phillosphy than Gatsby, it is inspired on it. And for the current verison 0.7.19 It works really fine. 
The documentation is still not complete, but enough. And the plugins are very extent. 

I build it firstly with the older blog in mind, but I also wanted to link the medium posts in my site. I made it easyly with the `source-filesystem` plugin. With this I can query all my post in the web.
In my prevous Gatsby version the home content was buit directly in the html. I wanted in this new version that the content was made as the blog posts in markdown ,and grisdoem make it availble. Iwas able to do it so if i have a new project that I want to share in my home page I just need to add a new markdown file correct header in my content folder.
About the style I was very hyper with the **Cyberpunk 2077** game , I have been always fan of science fiction, futursms, and cyberpubnk. I loved the cyberpunk page so I tried to imitate it a litle bit on my site.
I used bulma and buefy as my base CSS, I find it beautiflly made and easy to use. 

At the end I am very happy with the final result, and even if it took me some time it was not more that a couple of weeks in the afternoons. 

I enjoyed doing it and learned a lot and these are my goals to start a new project.
