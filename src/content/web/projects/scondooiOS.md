-This was a prove of concept of writting the scondoo iOS app from scratch. I used RXSwift, CoreData and MaterialDesign, following the same architecture I used in the Android version. Reactive Database as Single Source of truth.

-The main scondoo features where done. List, detail, login, and redeem a voucher.

-Unfortunately it was not released.
